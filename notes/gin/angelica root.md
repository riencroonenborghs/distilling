# Angelica root

Angelica root is generally considered to be the third most important botanical in gin, after juniper and coriander. This one is true Angelica, archangelica, not the Angelica sinensis variety that is commonly known as dong quai and used in Chinese traditional medicine. Archangelica is the correct species for use in gins.

### Taste

Angelica offers an earthy, herbal background flavour in gin, but is also commonly considered a “fixative” or “binding” agent that holds the flavours of other botanicals in place. This may be partly due to the effect it has on the final gin’s texture.

Like many root herbs, Angelica is also an important component of many bitters recipes.

###  Usage

Angelica sits in the third tier of botanicals, where usage rates typically range from 1 – 3 grams per litre of gin.
