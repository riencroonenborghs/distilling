# Orris root

Orris root is the root of the iris plant. It is one of the most important and commonly used botanicals in gin, acting as both a fixative and a flavouring in itself.

### Taste

The aroma of orris root is very strong, which is why it’s in the fourth tier of botanicals by addition rate, so not a lot is typically required. This aroma is powerfully floral, being most associated with violets, but also has an earthy quality that adds depth and feel to the final spirit.

### Usage

Orris root is not required in huge quantities in gin, although adding a big floral punch to suit your own tastes is of course part of the joy of making your own. Don’t go overboard at first or you may get the impression of drinking perfume. Typical usage would be less than 1 gram per litre of gin, and in most cases the ideal amount will be small fractions of a gram. 0.2 grams would be a good starting point.
