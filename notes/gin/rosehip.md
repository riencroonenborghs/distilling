# Rosehip

### Taste

Tangy, tart flavour with just a hint of floral perfume - more like an early plum or sweet-sour apple.
The fruity, tangy and toffee notes of rose hips complement orange, lemon, lime, rhubarb, apple, pear, mint, cardamom, ginger, vanilla, brown sugar and honey.

### Usage

Infusing.
