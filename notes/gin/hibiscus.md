# Hibiscus

Hibiscus has a tangy and cranberry-like flavor making it a great addition to cocktails. Hibiscus is also rich in antioxidants and considered healthier than roses.

Dried flower petals of the hibiscus plant (Hibiscus sabdariffa). It is one of the more common floral ingredients in gin and also one of the most common methods of creating a pink gin (a gin that is pink, not the cocktail).

### Usage

Aromas can be infused without adding colour using the standard gin approach of a botanicals basket within the still, or colours and flavours can be added by maceration (soaking the petals in the distilled spirit).

### Coloring

The colour added by hibiscus is used in many fruit teas so is probably familiar to many. In smaller doses it delivers a bright pink colouration, and in larger amounts it lends a deep ruby hue.

### Flavour

Flavour-wise, it is tart with robust, tangy berry flavours likened to pomegranate or cranberry.
