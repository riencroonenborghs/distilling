# Kola Nut

### Taste

Its flavour is bitter and astringent. Kola nuts have a bitter taste when chewed fresh. When they’re dried, the taste becomes milder and they reportedly smell of nutmeg.

### Usage
Use in moderation as it has a high caffeine content.

Use of Kola in gins is not common practice, but could form an excellent part of a gin’s overall flavour complexity.
