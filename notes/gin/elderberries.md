# Gin

## Elderberries

### Taste

Elderberries are generally not consumed raw. The berries are too bitter and astringent. However, when brewed down the elderberry has a tangy, tart taste to it.

The fruity, sweet flavour of the berries will leech out into the gin over time.

### Steeping

Steeping elderberries in the gin is a method that infuses the gin with the berries, producing the most incredible flavour. This steeping process takes time â€“ about a month.
