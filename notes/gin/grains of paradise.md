# Gin

## Grains of paradise

Grains of paradise are an odd but handy component of gin, as they are one of the spicy botanicals that help to balance out the sweeter flavours. They look a lot like black peppercorns but are actually more closely related to ginger.

### Taste

Flavour-wise, they have a warm spice similar to black pepper, but much milder. There are also companion flavours reminiscent of many other spices, including cardamom, nutmeg and citrus.

Like all our botanicals, these are provided in whole form to maximise freshness and aroma. They can either be crushed alongside your other botanicals (juniper, coriander, etc.) or put through a pepper grinder on an extra-coarse grind setting.

### Usage

Typical usage is 1 â€“ 3 grams of grains of paradise per litre of gin. The actual ideal amount is, of course, dependent on your own tastes.
