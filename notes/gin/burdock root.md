# Gin

## Burdock root

Burdock root is another of those botanicals we sell that’s not used in many gins, but certainly can be. It’s also got a couple of other key uses for which it’s better known: bitters and brewed beverages.

While not very well-known over our way, Dandelion & Burdock Root carbonated beverages are famous in the UK. Brewed traditionally, they are probably the closest British equivalent to a sarsaparilla root beer. They are more commonly made for the mass market using forced carbonation and artificial flavourings these days, but that doesn’t mean you can’t make the real thing at home.

### Taste

As a root herb, burdock is also one of the bittering components of many good bitters recipes. It has a sweet, earthy flavour and is regarded as having many good attributes as a health tonic.
