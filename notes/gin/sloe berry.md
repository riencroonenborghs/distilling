## Sloe berry

### Taste

Sloe berries are the fruit of Prunus spinosa, also known as blackthorn or — you guessed it — sloe. The berries have a tart astringency that makes for a great flavouring but leaves them a bit rough to eat outright, hence their typical use in spirits and jams.

### History

Sloe gin would be most famous sloe beverage, but most European nations have found one way or another to infuse them into something alcoholic. These other uses include in vodka, port/wine, neutral alcohol, and beer (lambic). The final product typically ends up as a deep ruby-red colour.

### Maceration

The berries are one of the few gin ingredients that you can use without a still, since they are macerated (soaked) into the gin once it’s already been distilled. That means you can use any finished normal gin you like as the base, whether it’s bought from a store or something you’ve made yourself.

### Recipe

There are plenty of recipes around on how to make sloe gin. Some start with fresh berries, and others are for dried berries (500 g dried berries equals about 1 kg of fresh berries). When using these dried berries, it is recommended that you rehydrate them first using the minimum amount of water possible. If you try to rehydrate them in the gin, the greedy little suckers will soak up half your gin and you’ll never get it back.

Some recipes suggest using up to one kilo of (fresh) berries for one litre of gin. Not only does this mean you actually have more sloe than you have gin, but it’s a pretty big financial whack unless you’re actually growing your own sloes. These recipes also require adding quite a lot of sugar to counter the sloe tartness, ending up as a thick liqueur.

### Usage

Maximum 250 g dried (500 g fresh equivalent) berries per litre of gin, infused into the final spirit post-distillation. Leave them in for two to three months or until the desired flavour and colour have developed. Sweeten to taste.
