# Puking

Puking happens when you overfill your boiler.

During the distillation, part of the wash will foam up and travel up the condenser. As a result you end up spirits that are cloudy and/or lightly coloured. It's those foams, carrying solid bits, which are usually what makes up the bulk of the puke in the still.

You can prevent this by adding butter, vegetable oil, mineral oils or silicone oils. It's less dense than the wash and it's not soluble in the wash, it will spread across the surface and disrupt the formation and stabilization of bubbles, which stifles the creation of foams.

Redistilling will get rid of the cloudyness.
