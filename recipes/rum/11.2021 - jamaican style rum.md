# Jamaican Style Rum

## November 2021

### Recipe

Main rules for rum:
  - yeast nutrients: 1g/L of wash
  - 5:1 ratio of molasses to water
    For 28L of wash we need 4.5kg of molasses
  - pH level 5.5-6
    Lower is more acidic, by adding eg. lemon juice.
  - yeast: 1g/L of wash

My ingredients:
  - 5L blackstrap molasses
  - 3L of dunder from my October rum
  - 2 tsp of [Springferm BR-2](https://fermentis.com/en/product/springferm-br-2/) [yeast nutrients](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%204.%202%20tsp.jpg?raw=true)
  - some lemon juice
  - 45g of [baker's yeast](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%205.%20yeast.jpg?raw=true)

## Mashing

  - sanitized the fermentation bucket with sodium metabisulphite
  - heated up the molasses in hot water to make it easier to work with
  - poured everything into the fermentation bucket with hot water to dissolve
  - added dunder and water to 28L in total
  - added yeast nutrition and stirred
  - checked ph, added lemon juice to bring the ph down to 5.6
  - forgot to check the ABV :(
  - added 45g of yeast to 1.5 cup of mash to rehydrate the yeast
  - pitched the yeast
  - aerated the mash

## Fermenting

  - put the heating belt on, 21 November 2021
