# Rum

## October 2021

### Recipe

Main rules:
  - yeast nutrients: 1g/L of wash
  - 5:1 ratio of molasses to water
    For 28L of wash we need 4.5kg of molasses
  - pH level 5.5-6
    Lower is more acidic, by adding eg. lemon juice.
  - yeast: 1g/L of wash

My ingredients:
  - [2L of golden syrup](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%201.%20golden%20syrup.jpg?raw=true)
  - [4 x 500ml blackstrap molasses](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%202.%20blackstrap%20molasses.jpg?raw=true)
  - 2 tsp of [Springferm BR-2](https://fermentis.com/en/product/springferm-br-2/) [yeast nutrients](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%204.%202%20tsp.jpg?raw=true)
  - 1 juice of a lemon
  - 45g of [baker's yeast](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%205.%20yeast.jpg?raw=true)
  I may have overdone it here.

## Mashing

  - sanitized the fermentation bucket with sodium metabisulfite
  - gently warmed the golden syrup and molasses in hot water to make it easier to work with
  - poured everything into the fermentation bucket with hot water to dissolve
  - added yeast nutrition and stirred
  - checked ph, added lemon juice to bring the ph down to [5.8](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%206.%205.8%20ph.jpg?raw=true)
  - checked ABV, sits at [1.060](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%203.%201.060.jpg?raw=true)
  - added 45g of yeast to 1.5 cup of mash to rehydrate the yeast
  - [pitched the yeast](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%207.%20yeast%20pitched.jpg?raw=true)
  - [aerated the mash](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%208.%20aerating.jpg?raw=true)
  - [24L](https://github.com/riencroonenborghs/distilling/blob/master/recipes/rum/10.2021%20-%209.%2024L.jpg?raw=true) of mash
