# Whiskey

## Grain whiskey (April 2021)

### Recipe

  - 5kg Munich Malt
  - 2kg Ale Malt
  - 1kg Oats
  - 300gr Dark Crystal
  - 200gr Choc Malt
  - 6kg Sugar
  - 1 cup Chopped Raisins
  - 60+gr brewer's yeast

### Mashing

Ideal Desired Mash Temperature is 63-66 degrees C.

  - Bring water up to strike water temperature.
  - Stir in the grains bit by bit, make sure there's no dough balls. We started at the Strike Water Temperature, when all grains have been added we should end up at the Desired Mash Temperature.
  - Top up with water to 20L but keep 63-66 degrees C.
  - Mix 6kg of sugar with 4L of water. Add 2 tsp cream of tartar/citric acid. Boil for 20 minutes. You now have inverted sugar which should be easier on the yeast [citation needed].
  - Divide wash and sugar over fermentation buckets if you have multiple. Pitch yeast.
  - Yeast is Angel Instant Dry Yeast. 60 gr.
  - Mop floor, this stuff is sticky!

### Fermentation

60L in total, divided into 3 20L buckets. Fermentation lasted around 2 weeks or so.

### Distillation

#### Stripping run

Stripped each bucket seperately. Not cuts, hard and fast.

Brought to temperature till gauge hit 68 degrees C, then turned off second heating element. Lots of vapours coming off that didn't get condensed, even at max. water flow. Temperature slowly crept up from 68 degrees C to about 73 degrees C, with a slow drip. Then relatively fast shot up to 92-93 degrees C and drip turned in to good trickle. Stayed at 93 degrees C for the run, slowly inching it's way up to 96 degrees C. At first the alcohol coming out was a faint yellow, but turned to clear pretty quickly.

Tasted very much like the grains. Hardly any alcohol burn towards to 96 degrees C, at which point I called it a day.

Collected everything into one big jar. 2.150L at 40 percent alcohol. No cuts, no discarding methanol.

#### Spirit run

Put all 3 jars from the stripping runs into the boiler with along with 3-4L of water to give the boiler some volume to work with. Turned on both heating elements. Heated up to 65 degrees C and turned off the second element.

**Foreshots**

Rule of thumb is to discard 4oz per 5 gallons of wash, or 120ml per 19L. In our case we had 60L of wash, so that's (60/19)*120 = 378ml. This is to be on the safe side of things.

Still heated up quickly, with a few drips coming out at 55 degrees C. Steady drip at 65 degrees C when I turned off second element. By time it hit 80 degrees C it was a steady stream. Collected 300ml of foreshots and discarded it (read: down the drain). Temperature went stable at around 85.5 degrees C. Swapped foreshot vessel for big 3L one because I think we're in the heads now. I don't see the temperature gauge changing whatsoever. Taste is quite nice, unlike any other spirits I've made before (duh!).

Collected about 1.65L in the 3L jar and swapped out for a smaller one. Taste was starting to veer off, and didn't want to collect into the big jar anymore. That was at 88.5 degrees C. I think we might be coming into the tails here.

Second small jar tasted like bread, but no funky taste, just different from the big jar.

3r jar, temperature rose to 91.1 degrees C. Tastes like Chinese food?!

4th jar, temperature at 92.3 degrees C.

5th jar, temperature at 94.1 degrees C.

6th jar, temperature at 95.8 degrees C.<br>

7th jar, temperature at 96.7 degrees C. Little to no alcohol coming out.

### Ageing

No idea what I did anymore. Notes lost :(
