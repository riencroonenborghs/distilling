Notes:

Turned off second heating element in the still at 60 degrees at 23 minutes in. Let it come up to temperature more gradually.

Took off no heads nor tails. Full spirit run with no cuts.

Let the still running till it reached 96 degrees. By then the taste was a bit funky, and hardly any alcohol burn.

Alcoholmeter is calibrated for 20°C. Measured 50% at 15°C temperature, adjusted to 53%.

Notes:
Dumped in the spirits from the previous run. Topped up with cold water, around 15 L. Still ran quite hot I thought, 95°C-ish. Spirits that came out was warm to the touch.

Discarded first 100ml.

Let it run till 98.2°C, by that time it was tasting bad and hardly any alcohol burn.

Collected 13 jars of approx. 200ml each.

Left the jars uncovered for 24h.

Kept jar 1-11. Yielded 2.150 L at 40% at 16°C, compensated to 42%.
