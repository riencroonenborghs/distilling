## Banana (8 November 2020)

### Recipe

3.5kg of fresh bananas
### Mashing

  - 11L
  - Started: 8 November 2020
  - Finished: 8 November 2020
  - Notes:
    Chopped 3.5kg bananas into chunks and added 5L of water. Tried to use the immersion blender to blend it all together, but the blender is broken. Used the food processor instead. Worked okay. Ended up with 11L of mash.
    Divided the mash into two pots, and heated each one up to 60-65째C.
    Added 3g of glucoamylase enzymes in each pot and covered the pots.
    Let is stand for 1 hour.
    Pitched everything back into the fermentation bucket and let it cool to 37째C.

### Fermenting

  - 11L
  - Yeast: Mangrove Jack's SN9 Premium Wine Yeast
  - Starting ABV: 1.09
  - Started fermentation on: 8 November 2020
  - Finishing ABV: 1
  - Finished fermentation on: 11 November 2020
  - Estimated ABV: 11.84210526
  - Steralized equipment: Yes
  - Steralized wash: No
  - Pectinase: No
  - Heating belt: Yes
  - Notes:
    Added the yest, put on the heating belt.
    Couldn't get a start ABV reading as the mixture is far too thick. So the start ABV above is an estimate.

    Fermentation was done on Tuesday/Wednesday (started on a Sunday). Nice yellow liquid with a thick "crust" on top. Slightly fizzy?

  - Notes:
    Used an old pillow case to filter out the solids before I started the still. Worked quite well. Will use the pillow case trick again.

    Started the still at 2000W until thermometer reached 60째C, then turned it down to 1000W and let it climb up slowly. Collected most of one small glass (~80ml) of foreshots and tossed it. Still runs very hot. Climbed straight up to high 90s and stayed at 96째C. Taste is amazing, not much alcohol.

    20 minutes in: nothing but banana flavoured water coming out. I'm shutting it down.
