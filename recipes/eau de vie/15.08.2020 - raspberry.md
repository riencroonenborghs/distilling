    In the morning, added 3 tsp of pectinase dissolved in a little warm water from the kettle.

    In the evening mixed the berries with a hand blender, but the blender conked out so left them whole-ish. Added 5kg of sugar since the berries measure literally zero ABV. After adding the sugar the volume went up to 19L. Added another 3 crushed up campden tablets to be sure. After sugar dissolved ABV measured 1.103. Didn't put on the heating belt this time since it's just to sterilize the wash.

    Put on the heating belt at noon to have the wash warm enough to pitch the yeast in the evening.

### Distilling

#### Spirits run

  - Alembic
  - Starting volume: 16.5L
  - Starting alcohol: 13.5%
  - Estimated ethanol: 4.06125L
  - Estimated methanol: 150mL
  - Estimated alcohol: 60%
  - Actual volume: 3.35L
  - Actual alcohol: 65%
  - Started distillation at: 15 August 2020 - 13:15
  - Finished distillation at: 15 August 2020 - 15:36
  - Notes:
    Put a fine mesh colander over the still, scooped of the top layer of dead yeast/scum from the fermentation bucket into the colander to drain. Emptied the colander. Switched to a hose to transfer the rest of the wash through the colander to catch any remaining dead yeast/scum.

    Turned on the still, both elements. Turned off one element at 60°C and let it come up to temperature more gradually. Temperature stabilized at around 88-89°C with a steady stream of spirits coming out of the still.

    Tasted every so often, but no raspberry flavour whatsoever. Maybe too much sugar?

    Hardly any alcohol coming through at 94°C.

    Measured 3.35L at 62°C at 15°C, adjusted to 65°C.
