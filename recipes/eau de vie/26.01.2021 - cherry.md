  - Notes
    Wash was too tick to get an ABV ready. Mixed half wash and half water and measured 1.022 ABV. Guessing it is 1.044.

    Had half a packet of yeast in the fridge from Feb 2020.
    Re-hydrated the yeast with some sugar in half a cup of lukewarm water. It was a bit foamy, add it to the wash anyway.
    See what happens over the next couple of days.

    Fermented out in a couple of days.
    Didn't get around to measuring the final ABV since it had been sitting, not bubbling for two weeks or so.

### Distilling

  - Finished distillation at: 8 February 2021 - 14:21
  - Notes:
    Lots of sediment at the bottom of the fermentation bucket. Managed to get 5 maybe 6L of wash out of it. Filtered it through an old pillow case and carefully siphoned around the floating bits of yeast.

    Slowly brought still up to temperature, turned off second element at 65 degrees C. Had to turn up the water flow as a lot of vapour come out of the spout uncondensed. Temperature shot up to 94 and then slowly crept up to 96 where it stayed a while.

    Taste if fairly good, although hardly any alcohol sensation. The temperature is far too high for just one element and only a few L in the boiler. Might have invest in some sort of electricity regulator thingamabob so I can more precisely regulate the boiler.

    Wet cardboard taste started to come through at around 97 degrees C, so turned off the still.
