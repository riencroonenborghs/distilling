    Boiler of the still is quite full (75% ish).
    Came up to temperature very slowly. Turned off second element at 71°C.
    Climbed slowly to 88-90°C with a drop coming out every second.
    Steady drop coming out at 94°C. Steadied at 95°C. Little to no alcohol coming out again. But I keep going.
    Collect as much as I can and distil a second time with the reflux still.
