# Gin

## Makrut gin (1 September 2020)

### Recipe

  - 1.3L 40% neutral white spirits from a (failed) raspberry eau de vie.
  - 20 g juniper berries
  - 6 g coriander seeds
  - 2 g angelica root
  - 2 g grains of paradise
  - 0.5 g orris root
  - 0.6 tsp dried hibiscus flowers
  - 0.5 lemon peel
  - 2 fresh crushed makrut lime leaves

### Maceration

Macerated 1 September - 4 September 2021.
Lightly crushed the juniper berries, coriander seeds, grains of paradise and makrut leaves. Made sure there was no pith on the lemon peel.

### Distilling

  - Reflux
  - Starting volume: 1.4L alcohol + 2L water
  - Starting alcohol: ~20%
  - Ended up with 0.5L at 80%
  - Notes:
    Everything in the still (spirits + botanicals) and added 2-3L of water, turned on the still and away we go.

    Collected 6 jars of 100mL, all relatively fast. Temperature hovered around 85°C for most of the process.

    Jar 1 through to 5 had very good taste: 1-2 lots of floral and makrut, 3-5 more pronounced gin flavours. Jar 6 was too much wet cardboard/dog taste and got discarded.

    Ended up with 500mL at 78° at 15° temperature, adjusted to 80°.
    
### Bottling

  - 0.5L at 80%
  - Target: 53%
  - Add 0.2547169811 water.
  I'd like to water it down to 40°, but don't want to have a second bottle with only a little in it, so 53° it is!
