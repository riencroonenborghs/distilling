# Gin

## Star anise gin (1 September 2020)

### Recipe

  - 1.3L 40% neutral white spirits from a (failed) raspberry eau de vie.
  - 15 g juniper berries
  - 4 g coriander seeds
  - 3 g angelica root
  - 1 g star anise
  - 2 g grains of paradise
  - 0.5 g orris root
  - 0.5 tsp dried hibiscus flowers
  - 0.5 lemon peel

### Maceration

Macerated 1 September - 5 September 2021.
Lightly crushed the juniper berries, coriander seeds and grains of paradise. Made sure there was no pith on the lemon peel.

### Distilling

  - Reflux
  - Starting volume: 1.4L alcohol + 2L water
  - Starting alcohol: ~20%
  - Ended up with 0.4L at 85%
  - Notes:
    Everything in the still (spirits + botanicals) and added 1.75L of water, turned on the still and away we go.

    5.5 jars of 100mL each collected. First 3 jars went relatively fast. Last 2.5 jars took ages. Last one hovered at 93째 with a small drip every 2-3 seconds. Time to shut it off. Taste wasn't the greatest around jar 4. See how it pans out after they have aired a little.

    Jars 1 - 4 tasted ok. Funk started to set in at jar 5, with grossness at jar 6. Left out jar 5 and 6.

    400mL at 82째 at 15째 temperature, adjusted to 85째.
    
### Bottling

  - 0.4L at 85%
  - Target: 45%
  - Add 0.3555555556 water.
