# Eau de vie

## Lime gin (1 September 2020)

### Recipe

1.3L 40% neutral white spirits from a (failed) raspberry eau de vie.
20 g juniper berries
6 g coriander seeds
2 g angelica root
2 g grains of paradise
0.7 g orris root
0.5 tsp dried hibiscus flowers
1 lemon peel
2 lime peel

### Maceration

Macerated 1 September - 6 September 2021.
Lightly crushed the juniper berries, coriander seeds and grains of paradise. Made sure there was no pith on the lime and lemon peel.

### Distilling

  - Reflux
  - Starting volume: 1.4L alcohol + 2L water
  - Starting alcohol: ~20%
  - Ended up with 0.4L at 78%
  - Notes:
    Everything in the still (spirits + botanicals) and added 1.75L of water, turned on the still and away we go.

    Collected 5 jars. First 3 quite fast. Jar 5 very slow and off taste, stopped when I reached 100mL.

    Jars 1 - 3 tasted ok. Funk started to set in at jar 4, with jar 5 a little too funky for my liking.

    400mL at 76° at 15° temperature, adjusted to 78°.
    
### Bottling

  - 0.4L at 78%
  - Target: 45%
  - Add 0.2933333333L water.
